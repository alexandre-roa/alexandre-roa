I'm looking for opportunity to start to work as fullstack developer. My favorites framework are NodeJS, React and React Native.
 
 In my free time I and watch soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).
